1. The emergence of new ideals.<br/><br>In the novel structures inhabited by the smol collection of anons who are pursuant of this frontier, perhaps we may find, eagerly awaiting us, a set of ideals emergent from the linguistic and operatic space in which we dwell. 21 DAO Themes seeks to catalog some of these monads and propose imagistic fundaments for them, which may contain a hyperstitial remnant of connectivity between the future and past. There are infact 23 unique themes in this series, terms related to contemporary degen and dao existence, and they are by no means exhaustive.  Each Theme can be thought of as an ideology, offered to the viewer similarly to a renaissance emblem. Parables and contiguous archetypes are woven through them, and cosmonomic theatrical space is employed.  Through the themes we may imagine ourselves as conversant (at least) with our current place upon the arch to the future, as DAOists of many diverse kinds of involvement, from builders to delegates to shitposters, with renewed awareness. All of the vocations and transmutation of self are unwound by the 21 Themes as if courtly participants in a geography. They are distended from the mundane and memorial, but cannot be described without it.<br><br>
2. A pantheon or map<br/><br>When imagining any ontology it is possible to arrange a sampling of the various elements of its constitution.  To do this, charts, graphs, dictionaries or illustrations may be applied, along with a multitude of other forms.  In the case of 21 DAO Themes, we have experimented with a format that is rather like a cosmology, involving equilibria of opposing activities (Exit, Entrance, Discord, Partnership) and between them forming a web of possible agentic principles.  Wrapping this are extensions into the henadic plane, including daemonic / angelic forms (Moloch, Abraxas) which guide broader movements and potentials, and finally a collection of rare  teleological beacons that operate in the memetic container.  These forms can be considered psychogeographically, like statues of the golden city of Golgonoza or lore items from any built-world of sufficient complexity.<br><br>
3. Poem, poster, oracle<br/><br>Extending from this exercise in taxonomy or lexical cataloging is the opportunity for each presentment of the Themes to be a unique statement, for singular intention and deliberation.  In the creation of the collection, this process of personal entrainment to a topos was explored. Each NFT contains a braiding of two monads together, becoming a rupture upon totalized frames, used perhaps for inspiration and conversation.  Each NFT has a pairing of two themes, allowing their Dionysian interiors to overlap and evoke novel positions in what amounts to the experiential, rather than the formal, sphere.  When you receive a 21 DAO Themes instance, you are in conversation with the woven voice of thematic elements, which is a superposition between allegory and glossolalia.  Each pairing might be just as easily a poem to consume, an inspirational poster for those who are acutely invested in the coming arraignment of human and digital matter, and an oracle card by which one might interpret some temporal bifurcation of their time at large.</p><br/><br/>Zemm * Naph<br/>Curator in Chief<br/>Cavewall.nexus<br/>
